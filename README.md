=============

#### DEMO: ####
http://candpgeneration.com/yahoo-finance
#### Notes: ####
Each box displays the percent change for the current interval. Click on each of the boxes to view latest quote details.

#### Known issues: ####
1. It's not 'Real Time' because I do not have access to real time data. 
2. The Yahoo Finance API returns bad data for certain indexes, so those have been commented out - as a result only 5 indexes are displayed in this demo. If one of those 5 fails, you will only see 4.. etc.
3. Best viewed in modern browsers (IE10+)
4. No Unit tests. :boom:

#### Caveats: ####
I am not a financier, hence I do not know what aspects of the data are 'important'. The % change for each interval is just UI sugar. More pertinent info can just as easily be displayed there.
